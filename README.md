# argocd-ambient

An ArgoCD ApplicationSet to deploy Istio Ambient Mesh with ArgoCD. Tested on AKS, where the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` and the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` need to ignore Azure-specific namespace labels. It combines public Istio Helm charts with locally-specified `values.yaml` files, as described in the [docs](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/multiple_sources/#helm-value-files-from-external-git-repository).
